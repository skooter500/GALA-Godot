This workshop is a hands on introduction to Godot for game development and research, delivered by Dr Bryan Duggan from TU Dublin. Godot is a free, open-source,  lightweight but powerful game engine for developing  mobile, PC, 2D, 3D and VR projects. Godot has comparable functionality to commercial Game Engines such as Unity or Unreal, but comes with a small download size of 100Mb, and a workflow that make it ideal for creative projects, classroom teaching, and research. It has many advanced capabilities, such as the node system for organising 2D and 3D scenes, built in code editing and debugging, and the ability to hot reload code into a running project. The editor can run efficiently on low end student laptops, and even a mobile phone running Godot engine can be used can develop VR projects using the Godot XR toolkit. Dr Bryan Duggan has been teaching Game Development, Creative Coding and VR for 23 years. Last year he switched from Unity to Godot after 8 years of work with Unity. In this workshop will share his experience on the process of switching engine, and he invites participants to be part of the future of open-source games education.
